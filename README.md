# Cubano Bread recipe

Hello guys, this is ***Bharath Satheesan***. I am here to give you the delicious recipe of the famous **French Bread**. French Bread or ***Baguette***, can be distinguished by its *long and crusty body*.

So, without any further ado, **let's get cookin'**!

## <u>Ingredients</u>

1. 75 ounces warm water
2. 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast*
3. 16 ounces bread flour
4. 2 teaspoons kosher salt
5. 10 ounces cool water (you may not need all of the water)
6. additional flour, for dusting

## <u>Instructions</u>
1. Measure the warm water in a small bowl and sprinkle the yeast on top. Set aside and allow the yeast to dissolve and become foamy.

2. Measure the bread flour into a large bowl and stir in the salt.

3. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, and stir in the dissolved yeast.

4. Add the cool water, a little at a time, while stirring, just until a stiff, shaggy dough (watch the video below to see what this should look like) has formed (you may not need to use all of the water).

5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow it to rest for 30 minutes.

6. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, and gently press it into a rectangle and fold into thirds.  Turn 90 degrees and repeat. 

7. Place the dough in a large oiled bowl, and cover with plastic wrap.  Allow it to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk (about 1 to 2 hours).

8. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions, and shape each one into a long loaf (about 15-inches long and 1 1/2-inches in diameter), with pointed ends.  

9. Place the loaves on a floured towel, cover with oiled plastic wrap, and allow to rise until doubled in bulk (about 30 to 45 minutes).

10. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F, and place a pan of water on the bottom rack.

11. Uncover the baguettes and transfer to lightly greased baking sheets.

12. Sprinkle with flour, and make 4 elongated slashes down each one with a lame, razor, or sharp knife. 

13. Bake the breads until crusty and brown (in my oven this takes around 35 to 40 minutes).  The baguettes should give a hollow sound when tapped.


**And, there you have it! Your own fluffy and delicious *Baguette*!**
